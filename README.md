## General info

**Music theory** is the study of the practices and possibilities of music. The Oxford Companion to Music describes three interrelated uses of the term *"music theory"*. The first is the *"rudiments"*, that are needed to understand music notation (**key signatures**, **time signatures**, and **rhythmic notation**); the second is learning scholars' views on music from antiquity to the present; the third a sub-topic of musicology that *"seeks to define processes and general principles in music"*. The musicological approach to theory differs from music analysis *"in that it takes as its starting-point not the individual work or performance but the fundamental materials from which it is built."*

Notes can be arranged in a variety of scales and modes. **Western music theory** generally divides **the octave** into a series of *twelve tones*, called a **chromatic scale**, within which the interval between adjacent tones is called a *half step* or *semitone*. Selecting *tones* from this **set of 12** and arranging them in patterns of *semitones* and *whole tones* creates other **scales**.

## Application

This application generates scales and its various variations. Contains functions to manipulate tonal elements of music (*note*, *chords*, *scales*). **Work in progress.**
